1
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,209
It is an extremely
common mistake,

2
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,583
people think the writer's
imagination is always at work,

3
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:05,416
that he's constantly
inventing an endless supply

4
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,592
of incidents and episodes,

5
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:11,468
that he simply dreams up
his stories out of thin air.

6
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:14,346
In point of fact,
the opposite is true.

7
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,518
Once the public
knows you're a writer,

8
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:19,392
they bring the characters
and events to you

9
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:22,270
and as long as you maintain
your ability to look

10
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:24,818
and to carefully listen,

11
00:02:25,018 --> 00:02:27,612
these stories
will continue to...

12
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:30,407
Stop it. Stop it! Don't! Don't do it!

13
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:40,076
Uh, will continue to seek
you out over your lifetime.

14
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:43,629
To him who has often
told the tales of others,

15
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,456
many tales will be told.

16
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,416
Sorry.
It's all right.

17
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:50,673
The incidents that follow
were described to me

18
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,882
exactly as I present them here

19
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:56,467
and in a wholly unexpected way.

20
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:05,274
<i>A number of years ago,</i>

21
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:08,354
<i>while suffering from a mild
case of "Scribe's Fever,"</i>

22
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:10,360
<i>a form of neurasthenia
common among</i>

23
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,278
<i>the intelligentsia of that time,</i>

24
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:14,359
<i>I decided to spend
the month of August</i>

25
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:18,493
<i>in the spa town of Nebelsbad
below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz,</i>

26
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:22,042
<i>and had taken up rooms
in the Grand Budapest,</i>

27
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:27,089
<i>a picturesque, elaborate, and once
widely celebrated establishment.</i>

28
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,838
<i>I expect some of
you will know it.</i>

29
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:34,839
<i>It was off season and, by
that time, decidedly out of fashion,</i>

30
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:36,970
<i>and it had already
begun its descent</i>

31
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:41,179
<i>into shabbiness and
eventual demolition.</i>

32
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:43,104
<i>What few guests we were</i>

33
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:45,649
<i>had quickly come to recognize
one another by sight</i>

34
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:48,898
<i>as the only living souls residing
in the vast establishment,</i>

35
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:53,149
<i>although I do not believe any acquaintance
among our number had proceeded</i>

36
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:56,236
<i>beyond the polite nods
we exchanged as we passed</i>

37
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:57,319
<i>in the Palm Court,</i>

38
00:03:57,527 --> 00:03:59,370
<i>in the Arabian baths,</i>

39
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,744
<i>and on board
the Colonnade Funicular.</i>

40
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,828
<i>We were a very reserved
group, it seemed,</i>

41
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:07,504
<i>and, without exception,
solitary.</i>

42
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,632
<i>Perhaps as a result of
this general silence,</i>

43
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:17,635
<i>I had established a casual
and bantering familiarity</i>

44
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,841
<i>with the hotel's concierge,
a West-continental</i>

45
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,052
<i>known only as Monsieur Jean,</i>

46
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,104
<i>who struck one
as being, at once,</i>

47
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:27,433
<i>both lazy and, really,
quite accommodating.</i>

48
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,818
<i>I expect he was not well paid.</i>

49
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:31,440
<i>In any case, one evening,</i>

50
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:34,114
<i>as I stood conferring
elbow-to-elbow with Monsieur Jean,</i>

51
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:38,660
<i>as had become my habit, I noticed
a new presence in our company.</i>

52
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,238
<i>A small, elderly man,
smartly dressed,</i>

53
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:44,370
<i>with an exceptionally lively,
intelligent face</i>

54
00:04:44,574 --> 00:04:47,578
<i>and an immediately perceptible
air of sadness.</i>

55
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:51,165
<i>He was, like the rest of us,
alone, but also, I must say,</i>

56
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:55,924
<i>he was the first that struck one
as being deeply and truly lonely.</i>

57
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:58,802
<i>A symptom of my own
medical condition as well.</i>

58
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:00,883
Who's this interesting
old fellow?

59
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,684
<i>I inquired of Monsieur Jean.</i>

60
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:05,512
<i>To my surprise,
he was distinctly taken aback.</i>

61
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:06,973
Don't you know?
<i>He asked.</i>

62
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,932
Don't you recognize him?

63
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,518
<i>He did look familiar.</i>

64
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:12,820
That's Mr. Moustafa himself.

65
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:14,441
He arrived earlier this morning.

66
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,861
<i>This name will no
doubt be familiar</i>

67
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,735
<i>to the more seasoned
persons among you.</i>

68
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:26,413
<i>Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time
the richest man in Zubrowka,</i>

69
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,755
<i>and was still indeed the owner
of the Grand Budapest.</i>

70
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,917
He often comes and
stays a week or more,

71
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,253
three times a year at least,
but never in the season.

72
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,805
<i>Monsieur Jean signaled to me
and I leaned closer.</i>

73
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,052
I'll tell you a secret.

74
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,600
He takes only a single-bed
sleeping room without a bath

75
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,552
in the rear corner
of the top floor

76
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:47,684
and it's smaller than
the service elevator!

77
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,231
<i>It was well known,</i>

78
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:51,976
<i>Zero Moustafa had purchased
and famously inhabited</i>

79
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:55,108
<i>some of the most lavish castles
and palazzos on the continent.</i>

80
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:58,615
<i>Yet here, in his own
nearly empty hotel,</i>

81
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:01,318
<i>he occupied
a servant's quarters?</i>

82
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:03,195
<i>At that moment, the curtain rose</i>

83
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,788
<i>on a parenthetical,
domestic drama...</i>

84
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:06,160
Shit.

85
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:09,244
<i>...which required the immediate
and complete attention</i>

86
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:11,419
<i>of Monsieur Jean,</i>

87
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,632
<i>but, frankly,
did not hold mine for long.</i>

88
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:23,924
<i>However,</i>

89
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:26,760
<i>this premature intermission in the
story of the curious, old man</i>

90
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:29,391
<i>had left me,
as the expression goes,</i>

91
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:31,724
"gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen,"

92
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:34,230
<i>that is, on the edge of my seat,</i>

93
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:37,313
<i>where I remained throughout
the next morning, until,</i>

94
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:41,276
<i>in what I have found to be its
mysterious and utterly reliable fashion,</i>

95
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:45,363
<i>fate, once again,
intervened on my behalf.</i>

96
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:51,284
I admire your work.

97
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:55,922
I beg your pardon?

98
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,796
I said, I know and admire
your wonderful work.

99
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:04,594
Thank you most kindly, sir.

100
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:07,054
Did <i>Monsieur</i> Jean have a word
or two to share with you

101
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:10,855
about the aged proprietor
of this establishment?

102
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:15,567
I must confess, I did
myself inquire about you.

103
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:18,361
He's perfectly capable,
of course, <i>Monsieur</i> Jean

104
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:20,314
but we can't claim he's a first,

105
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:23,196
or, in earnest,
even second-rate concierge.

106
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,527
But there it is.

107
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,242
Times have changed.

108
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:33,456
The thermal baths
are very beautiful.

109
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,207
They were in their
first condition.

110
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,963
It couldn't be maintained,
of course.

111
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,874
Too decadent for current tastes.

112
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:43,758
But I love it all just the same,
this enchanting old ruin.

113
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:47,387
How did you come to
buy it, if I may ask?

114
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,593
The Grand Budapest.

115
00:07:59,352 --> 00:08:00,353
I didn't.

116
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:11,831
If you're not
merely being polite,

117
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:14,751
and you must tell me
if that's the case,

118
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:17,955
but if it genuinely
does interest you,

119
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,507
may I invite you to
dine with me tonight,

120
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,511
and it will be my pleasure and,
indeed, my privilege to tell you

121
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:28,136
"my story."
Such as it is.

122
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:36,310
Two ducks roasted with olives.

123
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,893
Rabbit, salad?
Mmm.

124
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,819
Pouilly-Jouvet '52,
plus a split of the brut.

125
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:46,150
That should
provide us ample time

126
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,450
if I commence promptly.

127
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:48,659
By all means.

128
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:14,020
Well, it begins, as it must, with
our mutual friend's predecessor.

129
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:17,439
The beloved, original concierge
of The Grand Budapest.

130
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,901
It begins, of course, with...

131
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:45,376
Bring the table to the window.
Yes, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

132
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:48,053
Bring the tray to the table.
Right away, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

133
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:50,597
Right there. Have those
been brushed and blocked?

134
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:52,595
Of course, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.
Pack them in the hat boxes.

135
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:53,995
Is that from
Oberstdorf & Company?

136
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:54,976
I believe so, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

137
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:56,849
Second trunk. Who has the tickets?
I do, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

138
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:58,930
Give them to me.

139
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:02,101
These are in order.
Wait in the corner.

140
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:11,443
I'm not leaving.

141
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:12,694
I beg your pardon?

142
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:14,904
I'm not leaving.
Why not?

143
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:17,036
I'm frightened.
Of what?

144
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,441
I fear this may be the last
time we ever see each other.

145
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:21,123
Why on earth would
that be the case?

146
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:23,547
Well, I can't put it
into words, but I feel it.

147
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:24,999
For goodness sake,
there's no reason

148
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,363
for you to leave us if you'd...

149
00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:27,967
Come with me.

150
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:29,552
To fucking Lutz?

151
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:31,847
Please.
Give me your hand.

152
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:36,977
You've nothing to fear. You're
always anxious before you travel.

153
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:38,474
I admit, you appear
to be suffering

154
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:40,035
a more acute attack
on this occasion.

155
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:41,477
But, truly and honestly...
Oh, dear God.

156
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:43,020
What have you done
to your fingernails?

157
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:44,942
I beg your pardon? This
diabolical varnish.

158
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,028
The color is completely wrong.
Don't you like it?

159
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:50,027
It's not that I don't like it.
I am physically repulsed.

160
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:52,575
Perhaps this will soothe you.

161
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:54,327
What? Don't recite.

162
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:55,727
Just listen to
the words. Hush.

163
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:56,829
Please. Not now.

164
00:10:57,364 --> 00:11:00,914
"While questing once in noble
wood of gray, medieval pine,

165
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:05,293
"I came upon a tomb, rain-slick'd,
rubbed-cool, ethereal,

166
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:07,249
'its inscription
long-vanished,

167
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:09,880
yet still within its
melancholy fissures..."

168
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:12,962
Will you light
a candle for me, please?

169
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:15,556
In the sacristy of Santa Maria?

170
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,434
I'll see to it
myself immediately.

171
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:21,518
Remember, I'm always with you.

172
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:23,769
I love you.

173
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,229
I love you.

174
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:39,323
It's quite a thing winning the
loyalty of a woman like that

175
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:41,533
for 19 consecutive seasons.

176
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:43,702
Um... Yes, sir.

177
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,670
She's very fond of me, you know.

178
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:46,830
Yes, sir.

179
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,961
But I've never seen
her like that before.

180
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:50,166
No, sir.

181
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,628
She was shaking
like a shitting dog.

182
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,046
Truly.

183
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:57,636
Run to the cathedral of Santa
Maria in Brucknerplatz.

184
00:11:57,841 --> 00:11:59,559
Buy one of the plain,
half-length candles

185
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:01,114
and take back four
Klubecks in change.

186
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:03,100
Light it in the sacristy,
say a brief rosary

187
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:05,432
then go to Mendi's and get me
a <i>courtesan au chocolat.</i>

188
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,240
If there's any money left, give it
to the crippled shoe-shine boy.

189
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:10,979
Right away, sir.

190
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:12,105
Hold it.

191
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:16,155
Who are you?

192
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:18,028
I'm Zero, sir.
The new Lobby Boy.

193
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:19,453
Zero, you say?
Yes, sir.

194
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:20,906
I've never heard of you,
never laid eyes on you.

195
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:21,990
Who hired you?

196
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:23,324
Mr. Mosher, sir.

197
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:24,617
Mr. Mosher!

198
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,957
Yes, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave?

199
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:29,790
Am I to understand you've
surreptitiously hired this young man

200
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,170
in the position of a Lobby Boy?

201
00:12:31,374 --> 00:12:33,126
He's been engaged
for a trial period,

202
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,969
pending your approval,
of course.

203
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:36,341
Uh...

204
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:38,841
Perhaps, yes.
Thank you, Mr. Mosher.

205
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:41,309
You're most welcome,
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

206
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:44,183
You're now going to be
officially interviewed.

207
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:46,560
Should I go and light
the candle first, sir?

208
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,017
What? No.

209
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,817
Experience?

210
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:55,149
Hotel Kinski,
Kitchen Boy, six months.

211
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:57,529
Hotel Berlitz, Mop and
Broom Boy, three months.

212
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,077
Before that I was
a Skillet Scrubber...

213
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:00,537
Experience, zero.

214
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:01,613
Thank you again,
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

215
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:02,697
Straighten that cap, Anatole.

216
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,658
The pleasure's mine, <i>Herr</i> Schneider.
The strap's busted.

217
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:06,618
These are not acceptable.
I fully agree.

218
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,044
Education?

219
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,413
I studied reading and spelling.

220
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,874
I started my primary school.
I almost...

221
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:13,082
Education, zero.

222
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,255
Now it's exploded.

223
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,503
Good morning, Cicero.
Call the goddamn plumber!

224
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:17,866
This afternoon,
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave?

225
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,005
Without fail, <i>Frau</i> Liebling.

226
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:20,681
What in hell is this? Not now.

227
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,842
Family?

228
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:27,104
Zero.

229
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:29,307
Six, Igor.

230
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:38,574
Why do you want
to be a Lobby Boy?

231
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:45,039
Well, who wouldn't,
at the Grand Budapest, sir?

232
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,242
It's an institution.

233
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,712
Very good.

234
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,017
A thousand Klubecks.

235
00:14:08,137 --> 00:14:09,184
My goodness.

236
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:13,226
Were you ever a Lobby Boy, sir?

237
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:14,435
What do you think?

238
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,567
Well, I suppose you'd have
to start somewhere...

239
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,444
Go and light the goddamn candle.
Yes, sir.

240
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:25,655
<i>And so, my life began.</i>

241
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:29,788
<i>Junior Lobby Boy in-training,</i>

242
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:31,415
<i>Grand Budapest Hotel,</i>

243
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:34,793
<i>under the strict command
of Monsieur Gustave H.</i>

244
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:38,127
<i>I became his pupil, and he was
to be my counselor and guardian.</i>

245
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:40,052
<i>What is a Lobby Boy?</i>

246
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:43,632
<i>A Lobby Boy's completely
invisible, yet always in sight.</i>

247
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,884
<i>A Lobby Boy remembers
what people hate.</i>

248
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:47,890
<i>A Lobby Boy anticipates
the client's needs</i>

249
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:50,188
<i>before the needs are needed.</i>

250
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:53,483
<i>A Lobby Boy is, above all,
discreet to a fault.</i>

251
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:55,777
Our guests know
their deepest secrets,

252
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,445
some of which are,
frankly, rather unseemly,

253
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,363
will go with us to our graves.

254
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:00,816
So keep your mouth shut, Zero.

255
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,192
Yes, sir.

256
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:06,287
That's all for now.

257
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:08,410
<i>I began to realize
that many of the hotel's</i>

258
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:12,336
<i>most valued and distinguished
guests came for him.</i>

259
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:14,162
<i>It seemed to be an essential
pan' of his duties...</i>

260
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:15,588
Ah!

261
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:17,916
<i>...but I believe it
was also his pleasure.</i>

262
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,969
<i>The requirements
were always the same.</i>

263
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,639
<i>They had to be rich,</i>

264
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:25,931
<i>old,</i>

265
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:27,304
<i>insecure,</i>

266
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:28,555
<i>vain,</i>

267
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,012
<i>superficial,</i>

268
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:31,311
<i>blonde,</i>

269
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:33,014
<i>needy.</i>

270
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:36,225
Why blonde?

271
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:39,650
Because they all were.

272
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:41,235
<i>He was, by the way,</i>

273
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:45,034
<i>the most liberally perfumed
man I had ever encountered.</i>

274
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:48,078
<i>The scent announced his
approach from a great distance</i>

275
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:52,075
<i>and lingered for many minutes
after he was gone.</i>

276
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,959
<i>I worked six days each week
plus a half-day Sunday,</i>

277
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:59,416
<i>5:00 AM until
just after midnight.</i>

278
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,177
<i>Our meals were small but
frequent, for stamina.</i>

279
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:06,177
<i>Two breakfasts, two lunches
and a late supper.</i>

280
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,594
<i>Monsieur Gustave also
delivered a nightly sermon.</i>

281
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:13,897
Rudeness is merely
the expression of fear.

282
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:16,316
People fear they
won't get what they want.

283
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:20,020
The most dreadful and unattractive
person only needs to be loved,

284
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:22,651
and they will open
up like a flower.

285
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:24,448
I am reminded of a verse,

286
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:27,072
"The painter's brush
touched the inchoate face

287
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:29,244
by ends of nimble bristles

288
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:31,322
and with their
blush of first color,

289
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:33,324
rendered her
lifeless cheek living."

290
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:36,582
<i>His own dinner,
he took alone in his room.</i>

291
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,966
<i>The identity of the owner of the
hotel was unknown to all of us.</i>

292
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,970
<i>Each month, his emissary, known
as Deputy Kovacs, arrived</i>

293
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:52,017
<i>to review the books
and convey messages</i>

294
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:54,721
<i>on behalf of
the mysterious proprietor.</i>

295
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:57,899
<i>On these occasions, Monsieur
Gustave and our business manager,</i>

296
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:01,603
<i>Herr Becker, met with him in private
consultation above Reception.</i>

297
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:16,876
<i>This was also when I met Agatha,</i>

298
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,055
<i>but we won't discuss that.</i>

299
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,981
What do you want?
Look.

300
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,242
Dear God.

301
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,702
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

302
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:37,907
We must go to her.

303
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,991
We must?

304
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,835
<i>Tout de suite.</i>
She needs me, and I need

305
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:42,670
you to help me with
my bags and so on.

306
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:46,340
How fast can you pack?
Five minutes.

307
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,541
Do it. And bring a bottle
of the Pouilly-Jouvet '26

308
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:49,864
in an ice bucket
with two glasses

309
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:52,847
so we don't have to drink the cat
piss they serve in the dining car.

310
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:04,017
I blame myself.

311
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:08,067
She tried to tell me she had a premonition.
I didn't listen.

312
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:09,864
All of Lutz will
be dressed in black,

313
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:11,987
except her own ghastly,
deceitful children

314
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:14,239
whom she loathed and
couldn't bear to kiss hello.

315
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:16,741
They'll be dancing like gypsies.

316
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,834
There's really no point
in doing anything in life,

317
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:23,786
because it's all over
in the blink of an eye...

318
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:26,881
And, the next thing you know,
rigor mortis sets in.

319
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:29,925
Oh, how the good die young.

320
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:33,096
With any luck, she's left a few
Klubecks for your old friend,

321
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:34,847
but one never knows
until the ink

322
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:36,557
is dry on the death certificate.

323
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,893
She was dynamite in the sack,
by the way.

324
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:44,273
She was 84, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

325
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:45,934
I've had older.

326
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,727
When you're young,
it's all fillet steak,

327
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:50,939
but as the years go by, you have
to move on to the cheaper cuts,

328
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:53,403
which is fine with me,
because I like those.

329
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,861
More flavorful, or so they say.

330
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:01,240
Why are we stopping
at a barley field?

331
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:18,182
Well, hello there, chaps.

332
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:19,809
Documents, please.

333
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:22,011
With pleasure.

334
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:27,978
It's not a very flattering
portrait, I'm afraid.

335
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:29,811
I was once considered
a great beauty.

336
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:33,489
What does the "F" stand for?
Fritz? Franz?

337
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:34,941
Franz.

338
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,283
I knew it!

339
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:39,529
He's making a funny face.

340
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:43,329
That's a Migratory Visa with Stage
Three Worker Status, Franz, darling.

341
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:45,619
He's with me.

342
00:20:46,452 --> 00:20:47,499
Come outside, please.

343
00:20:48,996 --> 00:20:51,966
Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero.
His papers are in order.

344
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,634
I cross-referenced
them myself with

345
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,173
the Bureau of
Labor and Servitude.

346
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:57,221
You can't arrest him simply
because he's a bloody immigrant.

347
00:20:57,338 --> 00:20:59,511
He hasn't done anything wrong.

348
00:21:05,137 --> 00:21:07,060
Stop it, damn you!

349
00:21:07,306 --> 00:21:09,354
Never mind, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave!
Let them proceed!

350
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:11,185
Ow! That hurts!

351
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:16,820
You filthy, goddamn,
pock-marked, fascist assholes!

352
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:19,322
Take your hands
off my Lobby Boy!

353
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:32,548
What's the problem?

354
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:33,799
This is outrageous.

355
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:36,555
The young man works for me at the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad.

356
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:39,889
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave?

357
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:44,719
My name is Henckels.

358
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:49,102
I'm the son of Dr. and Mrs.
Wolfgang Henckels-Bergersdörfer.

359
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:51,066
Do you remember me?

360
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:55,734
I know exactly who you are. It's uncanny.
You're little Albert.

361
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:57,739
I'm terribly embarrassed.
Release them.

362
00:21:58,607 --> 00:22:00,735
Release them.

363
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,741
Hmm.

364
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:08,785
Your colleague is stateless.

365
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:11,276
He'll need to apply for a
revised Special Transit Permit,

366
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:14,754
which at this point may be
very difficult to acquire.

367
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:15,916
Take this.

368
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:18,962
It's temporary

369
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:20,467
but it's the best
I can offer, I'm afraid.

370
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:22,719
And how's your wonderful mother?

371
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:24,846
She's very well, thank you.
I adore her.

372
00:22:24,925 --> 00:22:27,223
Send my love.
I will.

373
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:29,980
Your companion
was very kind to me

374
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:31,974
when I was a lonely little boy.

375
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,482
My men and I apologize
for disturbing you.

376
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:37,730
I beg your pardon, sir.

377
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,300
You see? There are still faint
glimmers of civilization

378
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,298
left in this barbaric
slaughterhouse

379
00:22:59,418 --> 00:23:01,170
that was once known as humanity.

380
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,797
Indeed, that's what we provide

381
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,679
in our own modest,
humble, insignificant...

382
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:09,178
Oh, fuck it.

383
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:43,300
Where is she, Clotilde?
Take me to her.

384
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:20,875
You're looking so well, darling.
You really are.

385
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,426
They've done a marvelous job.

386
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:23,908
I don't know what sort of cream

387
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,045
they've put on you
down at the morgue,

388
00:24:25,254 --> 00:24:26,551
but I want some.

389
00:24:26,755 --> 00:24:29,008
Honestly, you look better
than you have in years.

390
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:31,218
You look like you're alive.

391
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:40,737
Oh, you changed it after all.
It's perfect.

392
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,734
Clotilde?
<i>Oui, Monsieur</i> Gustave?

393
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:44,945
A glass of chilled water
with no ice, please.

394
00:24:45,357 --> 00:24:46,449
Yes, M. Gustave...

395
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:49,845
...and, also, M. Serge would like to speak with you
privately in his office, please.

396
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:51,830
Oh.

397
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:53,916
All right, then.

398
00:24:54,116 --> 00:24:56,118
I shan't be long, darling.

399
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:59,417
<i>We were escorted
through a green baize door,</i>

400
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,959
<i>down a narrow service corridor
and into the butler's pantry.</i>

401
00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:07,972
<i>A moment later,
the kitchen passage swung open</i>

402
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:11,433
<i>and a small servant dressed in
white jolted into the room.</i>

403
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:14,603
<i>I've never forgotten
the look on that man's face.</i>

404
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:17,431
What the devil is going on?

405
00:25:18,057 --> 00:25:19,855
<i>I, myself,
had never set foot inside</i>

406
00:25:19,975 --> 00:25:21,773
<i>a house of this kind in my life.</i>

407
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:25,732
<i>I understood very little about
the events that were to follow.</i>

408
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,910
<i>But, eventually,
I came to recognize,</i>

409
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:32,613
<i>when the destiny of a great
fortune is at stake,</i>

410
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:36,576
<i>men's greed spreads like a
poison in the bloodstream.</i>

411
00:25:39,912 --> 00:25:42,085
<i>Uncles, nephews, cousins,</i>

412
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:44,917
<i>in-laws of increasingly
tenuous connection.</i>

413
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,627
<i>The old woman's
most distant relations</i>

414
00:25:46,835 --> 00:25:48,963
<i>had come foraging
out of the woodwork.</i>

415
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,591
<i>At the head of
this congregation,</i>

416
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:54,764
<i>it was
a disorienting coincidence,</i>

417
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:57,688
<i>we discovered our
own Deputy Kovacs,</i>

418
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,649
<i>himself an important attorney,
of course.</i>

419
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:04,194
<i>He was the executor
of the dead widow's estate.</i>

420
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:14,030
This is Madame D's
last will and testament.

421
00:26:15,322 --> 00:26:17,324
It consists of a general tontine

422
00:26:17,491 --> 00:26:21,371
drawn up before the event of her
husband's death 46 years ago,

423
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,794
in combination
with 635 amendments,

424
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:27,673
notations, corrections,
and letters of wishes

425
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:30,971
executed during
the subsequent decades.

426
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:34,967
The ultimate legality
of this accumulation

427
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:36,347
requires further analysis,

428
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,559
but in the opinion of this office,
it was Madame D's intention

429
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:41,682
that control of the
vast bulk of her estate

430
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:44,523
should be transferred,
forthwith, to her son, Dmitri,

431
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:47,355
with special allowances
for his sisters,

432
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:49,986
Marguerite, Laetizia,
and Carolina,

433
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,194
and minor gifts for various
members of the extended family

434
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:55,120
as shown in
the List of Recipients,

435
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:56,910
which I will elucidate
in due course.

436
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:00,367
However.

437
00:27:03,912 --> 00:27:05,209
An additional codicil,

438
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:08,717
delivered into my possession
by post only this morning,

439
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:11,254
and, by all indications,
sent by Madame D

440
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:12,824
during the last
hours of her life,

441
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:15,508
contains an amendment
to the original certificate,

442
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:19,721
which, as prescribed by law,
I will read to you now.

443
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:21,167
The authenticity
of this document

444
00:27:21,221 --> 00:27:23,382
has not yet been confirmed
by the presiding magistrate,

445
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:27,566
so I ask that all parties be
patient and refrain from comment

446
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,070
until such time as our
investigations can be completed.

447
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:43,252
"To my esteemed friend who
comforted me in my later years

448
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,754
and brought sunshine
into the life of an old woman

449
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:48,753
who thought that she
would never be happy again."

450
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,793
<i>"Monsieur</i> Gustave H,

451
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:54,930
I bequeath, bestow and
devise, free of all taxation

452
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:57,933
and with full and absolute
fiduciary entitlement,

453
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:00,599
the painting known
as <i>'Boy with Apple...'</i>"

454
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:02,479
Wow!
"...by Johannes van Hoytl..."

455
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:04,241
I can't believe it.
"...the younger..."

456
00:28:04,264 --> 00:28:05,390
What?

457
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:06,642
"...which gave us
both so much pleasure."

458
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:07,768
The van Hoytl?

459
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:08,977
Tax-free?
Can she do that?

460
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:11,230
Who's Gustave H?

461
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:14,112
I'm afraid that's me, darling.

462
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:18,787
That fucking faggot!

463
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:21,449
He's a concierge.
What are you doing here?

464
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:24,619
I've come to pay my respects
to a great woman whom I loved.

465
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:26,412
This man is an intruder
in my home!

466
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:28,084
It's not yours yet, Dmitri.

467
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:30,523
Only when probate is granted,
and the Deed of Entitlement...

468
00:28:30,624 --> 00:28:32,984
You're not getting <i>Boy with
Apple,</i> you goddamn little fruit!

469
00:28:34,628 --> 00:28:36,801
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

470
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:39,012
Call the police.
We're pressing charges.

471
00:28:39,258 --> 00:28:42,262
This criminal has plagued my
family for nearly 20 years.

472
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:44,437
He's a ruthless adventurer
and a con-artist

473
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:46,641
who preys on mentally feeble,
sick old ladies,

474
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:48,943
and he probably fucks them, too!

475
00:28:49,143 --> 00:28:51,271
I go to bed with all my friends.

476
00:29:00,654 --> 00:29:02,827
Where's Céline?

477
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,412
What?

478
00:29:04,491 --> 00:29:06,539
She's dead.
We're reading her will.

479
00:29:06,785 --> 00:29:09,004
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

480
00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:12,048
If I learn you ever once laid
a finger on my mother's body,

481
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:13,884
living or dead, I swear to God,

482
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,628
I'll cut your throat!
You hear me?

483
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:17,964
I thought I was supposed
to be a fucking faggot.

484
00:29:19,047 --> 00:29:20,264
You are, but you're bisexual.

485
00:29:20,382 --> 00:29:21,634
Let's change the subject.

486
00:29:21,842 --> 00:29:22,889
I'm leaving.

487
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:31,773
Wait here quietly. please.

488
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:35,197
That picture, <i>Boy with Apple,</i>
is priceless. Understand?

489
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:36,899
Congratulations,
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave!

490
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:38,867
They're going to fight me
for the son of a bitch.

491
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:40,159
Is it very beautiful?

492
00:29:40,277 --> 00:29:41,369
Beyond description.

493
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,039
"E'en the most gifted bard's
rhyme can only sing

494
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:46,246
but to the lack of her
and all she isn't!"

495
00:29:46,492 --> 00:29:48,870
"His tongue doth..."
Can I see it?

496
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:51,079
I don't see why not.

497
00:30:22,694 --> 00:30:25,117
This is van Hoytl's
exquisite portrayal

498
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:27,583
of a beautiful boy
on the cusp of manhood.

499
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:30,415
Blond, smooth. Skin as
white as that milk.

500
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:31,962
Of impeccable provenance.

501
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:35,708
One of the last in private hands,
and unquestionably, the best.

502
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:37,213
It's a masterpiece.

503
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:39,465
The rest of this shit
is worthless junk.

504
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,473
<i>M. Gustave?</i>

505
00:31:30,804 --> 00:31:32,647
Can I help you?

506
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,515
Yes. Serge.

507
00:31:34,516 --> 00:31:36,439
You can wrap this up. please.

508
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:37,810
Wrap up...

509
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:39,484
Wrap up... "Boy With Apple"?

510
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,009
What did you want
to tell me, before?

511
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:04,338
I think I cannot say right now.

512
00:32:04,546 --> 00:32:06,844
Write me tomorrow.
Lutzbahn Station!

513
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,812
I'll never part with it.

514
00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:25,401
It reminded her of me. It will
remind me of her. Always.

515
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:28,325
I'll die with this
picture above my bed.

516
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:30,530
See the resemblance?

517
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:33,533
Oh, yes.

518
00:32:38,872 --> 00:32:40,590
Actually, we should sell it.

519
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:43,836
Sooner rather than later, in
case they try to steal it back.

520
00:32:44,044 --> 00:32:45,405
Plus, something about
those lunatic

521
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:46,759
foot-soldiers
on the express...

522
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:50,384
This could be a tricky war and a
long dry spell in the hotel trade.

523
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,099
For all we know, they could
board us up tomorrow.

524
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:01,402
Let's make
a solemn blood-pact.

525
00:33:01,603 --> 00:33:03,923
We'll contact the black market
and liquidate <i>Boy with Apple</i>

526
00:33:04,106 --> 00:33:05,107
by the end of the week,

527
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,567
then leave the country
and lay low

528
00:33:06,733 --> 00:33:08,110
somewhere along
the Maltese Riviera

529
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,863
until the troubles blow over
and we resume our posts.

530
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:12,789
In exchange for
your help, your loyalty

531
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:14,783
and your services
as my personal valet,

532
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:19,539
I pledge to you 1.5%
of the net sale price.

533
00:33:19,746 --> 00:33:21,748
1.5?
Plus room and board.

534
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,628
Could we make it 10?
10? Are you joking?

535
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:27,595
That's more than
I'd pay an actual dealer,

536
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:30,098
and you wouldn't know chiaroscuro
from chicken giblets.

537
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:31,978
No, 1.5 is correct.
But I'll tell you what,

538
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:35,391
if I die first, and I most certainly
will, you will be my sole heir.

539
00:33:35,595 --> 00:33:36,995
There's not much
in the kitty except

540
00:33:37,055 --> 00:33:38,398
a set of ivory-backed
hairbrushes

541
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:39,941
and my library of
romantic poetry,

542
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:42,770
but when the time comes,
these will be yours,

543
00:33:42,978 --> 00:33:46,278
along with whatever we haven't
already spent on whores and whiskey.

544
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,068
This is our sacred bond.

545
00:33:49,276 --> 00:33:51,278
I'll draw it up right now.

546
00:33:56,283 --> 00:34:00,333
I, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave H, being of
relatively sound mind and body,

547
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:02,422
on this day,
the 19th of October,

548
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:04,416
in the year of our Lord 1932...

549
00:34:04,624 --> 00:34:07,468
<i>He never told
me where he came from.</i>

550
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:13,175
<i>I never asked who
his family had been.</i>

551
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,114
Excuse me.

552
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:37,783
Uh-huh?

553
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:42,329
The police are here.
They asked for you.

554
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:48,210
Tell them I'll be right down.

555
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:51,004
Okay.

556
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:58,224
Have you ever been questioned
by the authorities?

557
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,831
Yes, on one occasion
I was arrested

558
00:34:59,846 --> 00:35:01,143
and tortured by
the rebel militia

559
00:35:01,348 --> 00:35:02,395
after the Desert Uprising.

560
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:04,564
You know the drill, then. Zip it.
Of course.

561
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:08,189
You've never heard the word "van
Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go.

562
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:25,205
How may we serve you, gentlemen?

563
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,666
Ah, Inspector Henckels.

564
00:35:27,874 --> 00:35:30,423
"By order of the Commissioner
of Police, Zubrowka Province,

565
00:35:30,669 --> 00:35:32,470
I hereby place you under
arrest for the murder

566
00:35:32,587 --> 00:35:35,056
of Madame Céline Villeneuve
Desgoffe und Taxis."

567
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:36,717
I knew there was
something fishy.

568
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:38,344
We never got the cause of death.

569
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:41,726
She's been murdered
and you think I did it.

570
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,392
Hey!

571
00:35:47,227 --> 00:35:49,229
Stop!

572
00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:40,451
What happened?

573
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:43,124
What happened, my dear Zero,
is I beat the living shit

574
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:45,957
out of a sniveling little runt
called Pinky Bandinski

575
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:47,959
who had the gall to
question my virility,

576
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:50,419
because if there's one thing we've
learned from penny dreadfuls,

577
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:52,785
it's that, when you find
yourself in a place like this,

578
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:54,302
you must never
be a candy-ass.

579
00:36:54,502 --> 00:36:56,470
You've got to prove
yourself from Day One.

580
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,132
You've got to win their respect.

581
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:01,594
You should take a long look
at his ugly mug this morning.

582
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,773
He's, actually,
become a dear friend.

583
00:37:06,973 --> 00:37:08,475
You'll meet him, I hope.

584
00:37:09,476 --> 00:37:11,524
So. You've talked to Kovacs?

585
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,147
I saw him last night in secret.

586
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:15,636
He made me take an oath on a
Bible I wouldn't tell a soul.

587
00:37:15,774 --> 00:37:16,866
You're supposed to also.

588
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:18,155
I'll do that later.

589
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:19,490
He suspects you're innocent.

590
00:37:19,653 --> 00:37:20,825
Of course he does.

591
00:37:20,987 --> 00:37:22,785
What's the charge?

592
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:27,169
In the small hours of
the evening of 19 October,

593
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:30,418
an individual well-known to the house
and staff, a <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave H,

594
00:37:30,622 --> 00:37:33,751
did arrive at the Desgoffe
und Taxis residence in Lutz

595
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:36,462
and entered by
the rear service alley,

596
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,013
alerting no one to his presence,

597
00:37:38,213 --> 00:37:41,968
and did then proceed by way of
back stairs and servants' passage,

598
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:44,519
to deliver himself into the
private chambers of Madame D.

599
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:47,268
There is no evidence
to indicate whether this visit

600
00:37:47,472 --> 00:37:49,941
had been pre-arranged
with her or not.

601
00:37:50,141 --> 00:37:55,022
The next morning Madame D was found
dead by strychnine poisoning.

602
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,391
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave was not
observed on the premises again

603
00:37:57,565 --> 00:38:00,739
until, of course,
24 hours later.

604
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:03,197
The identity of
his accusers is made

605
00:38:03,363 --> 00:38:05,616
clear in this
notarized deposition.

606
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,249
They include, essentially, all
members of the extended family,

607
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:14,174
but the key witness who actually
ostensibly saw the alleged events

608
00:38:14,374 --> 00:38:17,002
appears to have
fled the jurisdiction.

609
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,883
His whereabouts are
currently unknown,

610
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:21,715
but he's being sought and pursued
by the relevant authorities.

611
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:24,017
Who is he?

612
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:29,139
Serge?

613
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:30,265
I'm afraid so.

614
00:38:30,473 --> 00:38:32,726
That little prick.

615
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:35,062
No, I don't believe it.
They put him up to it.

616
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,398
I've been dropped
into a nest of vipers.

617
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:38,606
You have an alibi?

618
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:40,988
Of course, but she's married
to the Duke of Westphalia.

619
00:38:41,192 --> 00:38:43,833
I can't allow her name to get
mixed-up in all this monkey business.

620
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:45,872
Your life may be at stake.

621
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:47,832
I know, but the bitch legged it.

622
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:51,788
She's already on board the <i>Queen
Nasstasja</i> halfway to Dutch Tanganyika.

623
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:55,541
Don't give up.

624
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:03,139
<i>The details of the conspiracy,</i>

625
00:39:04,257 --> 00:39:06,385
<i>now a matter of public record,</i>

626
00:39:06,593 --> 00:39:09,722
<i>were, at that time, impossible
for us to apprehend.</i>

627
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:28,619
I'm looking for Serge X,

628
00:39:28,823 --> 00:39:31,667
a young man in
the service of my employer,

629
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:35,372
the family Desgoffe und Taxis
of Schloss Lutz.

630
00:39:36,998 --> 00:39:38,591
Yes, sir?
You're his sister?

631
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,174
Yes, sir.
Seen him lately?

632
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:44,465
No, sir.
No, sir?

633
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:46,549
No, sir.

634
00:39:49,969 --> 00:39:52,768
I need to find him right away,
for his own safety

635
00:39:52,972 --> 00:39:54,519
and everybody else's.

636
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:57,398
If he shows up...

637
00:39:57,602 --> 00:40:00,355
Yes, sir?
Tell him Jopling says,

638
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:02,816
"Come home."

639
00:40:04,984 --> 00:40:07,578
<i>But one thing was certain,</i>

640
00:40:09,614 --> 00:40:13,209
<i>the Desgoffe und Taxis
were a very powerful family,</i>

641
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,549
<i>and time was not on our side.</i>

642
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:30,348
A letter from
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave. Zero.

643
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:33,263
You want me to?
Read it.

644
00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:41,070
"My dear and
trusted colleagues..."

645
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:43,319
I miss you deeply
as I write from the confines

646
00:40:43,523 --> 00:40:46,527
of my regrettable and
preposterous incarceration.

647
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:48,828
Until I walk amongst
you again as a free man,

648
00:40:49,028 --> 00:40:51,406
the Grand Budapest
remains in your hands,

649
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:53,787
as does its
impeccable reputation.

650
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:55,994
Keep it spotless and glorify it.

651
00:40:56,202 --> 00:40:58,546
Take extra special care of
every little-bitty bit of it

652
00:40:58,746 --> 00:41:00,840
as if I were watching
over you like a hawk

653
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,510
with a horse whip in its
talons, because I am.

654
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:07,760
Should I discover a lapse of
any variety during my absence,

655
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:11,594
I promise, swift and merciless
justice will descend upon you.

656
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:15,772
A great and noble house has been
placed under your protection.

657
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:18,600
Tell Zero if you see
any funny business.

658
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:20,936
"Your devoted
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave."

659
00:41:21,144 --> 00:41:23,464
Then there's a poem, but we
might want to start on the soup

660
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:24,982
since it's 46 stanzas.

661
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:29,946
"A moist, black ash dampens the
filth of a dung-dark rat's nest

662
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:32,247
and mingles with
the thick scent of wood rot

663
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:34,245
while the lark song
of a guttersnipe..."

664
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:36,702
I never trusted that butler.

665
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,708
He's too honest.

666
00:41:38,828 --> 00:41:40,580
<i>- Too honest, you say?</i>
Mmm-hmm.

667
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:42,916
<i>Right, well, be that as it may,</i>

668
00:41:43,082 --> 00:41:45,084
<i>find him quick
and make it snappy.</i>

669
00:42:01,392 --> 00:42:03,986
May I offer any of you
inmates a plate of mush?

670
00:42:06,481 --> 00:42:07,903
No? Anyone?

671
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:10,360
You with the very
large scar on your face?

672
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:22,623
Try it. It's actually quite warm
and nourishing this morning.

673
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,877
It needs a dash of salt.

674
00:42:32,757 --> 00:42:34,304
Good day.

675
00:42:39,138 --> 00:42:41,140
Mush, gents?
Any takers?

676
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,817
Suit yourselves.

677
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,033
Rise and shine.
Chop, chop.

678
00:42:55,613 --> 00:42:56,830
Good morning, Pinky.

679
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,917
Mendl's again?

680
00:43:03,997 --> 00:43:05,214
Precisely.

681
00:43:05,415 --> 00:43:07,417
Who's got the throat slitter?

682
00:43:13,006 --> 00:43:14,428
Out of this world.

683
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:15,926
Mendi's is the best.

684
00:43:16,134 --> 00:43:18,262
Well, back to work.
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave?

685
00:43:21,848 --> 00:43:23,270
Yes?

686
00:43:27,061 --> 00:43:29,359
Me and the boys talked it over.

687
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:32,033
We think you're
a really straight fellow.

688
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:34,406
Well, I've never been
accused of that before,

689
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:36,579
but I appreciate the sentiment.

690
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:38,156
You're one of us now.

691
00:43:39,449 --> 00:43:41,417
What a lovely thing to say.

692
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:43,495
Thank you, dear Pinky.
Thank you, Günther.

693
00:43:43,703 --> 00:43:45,125
Thank you, Wolf.

694
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,332
Anything else?

695
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:50,214
Tell him, Ludwig.

696
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,470
Checkpoint 19 ain't
no two-bit hoosegow.

697
00:43:55,673 --> 00:43:58,927
You got broad-gauge iron bars
on every door, vent and window.

698
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:02,730
You got 72 guards on the floor
and 16 more in the towers.

699
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:07,231
You got a 325-foot drop into
a moat full of crocodiles.

700
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:09,403
But, like the best of them,
it's got a soft spot,

701
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:11,356
which in this case
happens to take the form

702
00:44:11,564 --> 00:44:13,692
of a storm-drain sewer system

703
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,198
dating from the time of the
original rock fortification

704
00:44:16,402 --> 00:44:18,450
way back in the Middle Ages.

705
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:21,750
Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll
down a tree-lined promenade

706
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:23,701
with a fine lady
and a white poodle,

707
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:27,540
but it's got what
you'd call "vulnerability,"

708
00:44:27,747 --> 00:44:30,421
and that's our bread and butter.

709
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,423
Take a look.

710
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:35,972
Who drew this?

711
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:38,266
What do you mean,
"Who drew this?" I did.

712
00:44:38,466 --> 00:44:40,560
Very good. You've got
a wonderful line, Ludwig.

713
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,433
This shows great
artistic promise.

714
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:46,016
Question, how do you intend to
penetrate this lowest rudiment?

715
00:44:46,224 --> 00:44:48,773
It's 25 inches of reinforced
granite masonry, is it not?

716
00:44:48,976 --> 00:44:50,694
Digging with
the throat-slitter,

717
00:44:50,895 --> 00:44:53,523
I expect this would take three to
six months of continual effort,

718
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:55,292
during which time
several of our members

719
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:56,863
will have been
violently executed.

720
00:44:57,068 --> 00:44:59,412
You hit the nail on the head,
Mr. Gustave.

721
00:44:59,612 --> 00:45:02,206
We got fake documents,
second-hand street clothes,

722
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:04,785
a rope ladder made of
sticks and bunk-linens,

723
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:06,869
but we need digging tools,

724
00:45:07,078 --> 00:45:10,048
which are proving hard to
come by in this flop-house.

725
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:26,069
<i>At this point in the story,</i>

726
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,775
<i>the old man fell silent and
pushed away his saddle of lamb.</i>

727
00:45:29,976 --> 00:45:32,820
<i>His eyes went
blank as two stones.</i>

728
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,022
<i>I could see he was in distress.</i>

729
00:45:35,231 --> 00:45:36,448
Are you ill,
Mr. Moustafa?

730
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:37,783
<i>I finally asked.</i>

731
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:39,076
Oh, dear me, no.

732
00:45:39,193 --> 00:45:40,285
<i>He said.</i>

733
00:45:40,486 --> 00:45:42,909
It's only that I don't
know how to proceed.

734
00:45:44,115 --> 00:45:46,288
<i>He was crying.</i>

735
00:45:46,492 --> 00:45:47,994
You see,
I never speak of Agatha,

736
00:45:48,202 --> 00:45:51,797
because even at
the thought of her name

737
00:45:51,998 --> 00:45:54,751
I'm unable to
control my emotions.

738
00:45:57,837 --> 00:46:00,090
Well, I suppose
there's no way around it.

739
00:46:01,382 --> 00:46:03,726
You see, she saved us.

740
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:05,853
<i>On our third formal rendezvous,</i>

741
00:46:06,053 --> 00:46:08,977
<i>I had asked for her hand in
marriage and she had agreed.</i>

742
00:46:09,056 --> 00:46:11,058
Will you marry me?
Yes.

743
00:46:12,852 --> 00:46:15,731
<i>We did not have 50 Klubecks
between the two of us.</i>

744
00:46:15,938 --> 00:46:19,192
<i>No one knew, of course, but,
then, who would have cared?</i>

745
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,153
<i>We were each completely
on our own in the world,</i>

746
00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:25,281
<i>and we were deeply in love.</i>

747
00:46:34,081 --> 00:46:35,924
Here.
Thank you.

748
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:37,968
It's a book.
I see.

749
00:46:38,169 --> 00:46:39,671
<i>Romantic Poetry, Volume One.</i>

750
00:46:39,879 --> 00:46:41,119
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave recommended it.

751
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,410
I have a copy of my own as well.

752
00:46:42,423 --> 00:46:44,391
I ruined the surprise,
I suppose.

753
00:46:44,509 --> 00:46:46,477
I'll go ahead
and open it, anyway.

754
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:51,933
Read the inscription.

755
00:47:10,451 --> 00:47:11,543
<i>Monsieur Gustave insisted</i>

756
00:47:11,744 --> 00:47:13,997
<i>on an immediate and thorough
cross-examination...</i>

757
00:47:14,205 --> 00:47:15,878
She's charming.
She's so charming.

758
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:19,506
<i>...during which he presented
Agatha with a porcelain pendant</i>

759
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,634
<i>and five dozen individually
tissue-wrapped white tulips</i>

760
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,967
<i>in a box the size
of a child's coffin.</i>

761
00:47:25,174 --> 00:47:26,471
It's not right.

762
00:47:26,592 --> 00:47:27,889
I beg your pardon?

763
00:47:28,094 --> 00:47:29,266
Why is he sulking?

764
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,470
She's my girlfriend.
You can't just buy her things.

765
00:47:31,556 --> 00:47:34,901
I'm only interviewing this vision
of loveliness on your behalf.

766
00:47:35,101 --> 00:47:37,695
Never be jealous in this life,
Zero, not even for an instant.

767
00:47:37,895 --> 00:47:39,442
Is he flirting with you?

768
00:47:40,731 --> 00:47:42,233
Yes.

769
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:43,860
I approve of this union.

770
00:47:44,068 --> 00:47:46,571
Agatha, my beauty,
return to your beloved.

771
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:48,076
<i>Soon we learned...</i>

772
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:49,999
Blessings upon you both.

773
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:51,917
<i>...not only was Agatha
immensely skilled</i>

774
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:54,621
<i>with a palette knife and
a butter-cream flourish...</i>

775
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:56,831
Mendl.
Go.

776
00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:00,001
<i>...she was also very brave.</i>

777
00:48:04,463 --> 00:48:06,557
<i>I believe she was born that way.</i>

778
00:48:25,943 --> 00:48:27,991
Something's missing.

779
00:48:28,195 --> 00:48:32,666
A crucial document, either misplaced
or, conceivably, destroyed.

780
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:35,370
I don't know what it contains, I
don't know what it represents,

781
00:48:35,578 --> 00:48:36,955
I don't know what it is,

782
00:48:37,163 --> 00:48:40,258
but there are traces
and shadows of it everywhere.

783
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:42,176
Now, I don't want to alarm you,

784
00:48:42,376 --> 00:48:44,256
and I don't expect to see
any significant change

785
00:48:44,295 --> 00:48:45,735
in the magistrate's
ultimate decision

786
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:47,306
vis-à-vis your
own inheritance,

787
00:48:47,506 --> 00:48:51,306
but, especially given the
circumstances of the death,

788
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,683
as well as the disappearance
of the key witness

789
00:48:53,846 --> 00:48:55,974
in the murder case, Serge X,

790
00:48:56,182 --> 00:48:58,023
I suggest that we immediately
bring this matter

791
00:48:58,059 --> 00:49:00,278
to the attention of
the municipal inspector

792
00:49:00,478 --> 00:49:02,230
so that there can be
absolutely no question

793
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:04,816
of impropriety
at any future date.

794
00:49:05,024 --> 00:49:06,776
Agreed?
Not agreed.

795
00:49:08,611 --> 00:49:10,705
Not agreed?
Not agreed.

796
00:49:13,407 --> 00:49:15,000
Can I ask you a question,
Vilmos?

797
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:16,664
Yes, Dmitri?

798
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:18,166
Who are you working for?

799
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:19,539
I beg your pardon?

800
00:49:19,747 --> 00:49:21,545
Who are you working for?

801
00:49:21,707 --> 00:49:23,505
I thought you're supposed
to be our lawyer.

802
00:49:23,709 --> 00:49:25,177
Well, in point of fact,

803
00:49:25,252 --> 00:49:27,095
I'm the executor of the estate.

804
00:49:27,296 --> 00:49:31,426
In this particular situation,
I represent the deceased.

805
00:49:31,634 --> 00:49:32,635
Oh, yeah?

806
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,513
Yeah. A provision for my fees
was included in the...

807
00:49:35,721 --> 00:49:40,522
Just wrap it up and
don't make waves. Agreed?

808
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,488
I'm an attorney.
I'm obligated to

809
00:49:44,605 --> 00:49:46,573
proceed according
to the rule of law.

810
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:49,068
Not agreed.

811
00:49:55,658 --> 00:49:57,706
This stinks, sisters.

812
00:50:01,163 --> 00:50:03,211
Did he just throw
my cat out the window?

813
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,298
I don't think so.

814
00:50:06,377 --> 00:50:07,378
No. Did he?
Jopling?

815
00:50:19,765 --> 00:50:21,267
Shh-Shh.

816
00:50:34,363 --> 00:50:36,365
Okay.

817
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:49,670
There's something
I haven't told you, Agatha.

818
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:51,096
Okay.
We stole a painting.

819
00:50:51,297 --> 00:50:53,846
It's very valuable, maybe five
million Klubecks, in fact.

820
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,927
I don't know if anyone's
even noticed it's missing yet,

821
00:50:56,135 --> 00:50:57,728
but if something
should happen to me...

822
00:50:57,928 --> 00:50:59,430
You steal art?

823
00:51:00,514 --> 00:51:03,563
One picture. Anyway, we need to
make a plan for your survival.

824
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:06,648
Hide this. It's in code and you might
need a magnifying glass to read it,

825
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:09,211
but it tells you exactly where
and how to find <i>Boy with</i> Apple.

826
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:11,279
Don't take less than half the
retail asking price. Also...

827
00:51:11,484 --> 00:51:12,781
Zero, I'm a baker.

828
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:14,199
You're a pastry chef.

829
00:51:14,403 --> 00:51:16,280
I'm not a fence,
if that's the term.

830
00:51:16,489 --> 00:51:18,366
I don't trade in
stolen property.

831
00:51:19,617 --> 00:51:21,460
I said it wrong.
She willed it to him.

832
00:51:30,836 --> 00:51:32,838
Go to sleep.

833
00:51:33,506 --> 00:51:35,349
Yes, <i>Herr</i> Mendl.

834
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,846
Hide this.
No.

835
00:51:40,054 --> 00:51:42,056
Okay, but take it anyway.

836
00:55:08,053 --> 00:55:11,273
<i>The next morning,
Herr Becker received a peculiar,</i>

837
00:55:11,473 --> 00:55:14,192
<i>last-minute notice from the
office of Deputy Kovacs,</i>

838
00:55:14,393 --> 00:55:18,864
<i>postponing their scheduled
meeting, in perpetuity.</i>

839
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:50,971
Let's blow.

840
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:02,001
How did you get out there?

841
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:03,378
Shut the fuck up.

842
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:06,213
These guys are trying to escape.

843
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,140
What's wrong with you,
you goddamn snitch?

844
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,342
Guard! Guard!

845
00:57:17,641 --> 00:57:18,893
It's you.
Thank you.

846
00:57:18,976 --> 00:57:21,104
Thank you, you sweet, kind man.

847
00:57:50,966 --> 00:57:52,968
Okay.

848
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,363
Whoa!

849
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,628
I suppose you'd
call that a draw.

850
00:59:18,762 --> 00:59:20,764
Good evening.

851
00:59:29,022 --> 00:59:32,652
Let me introduce you. Pinky, Wolf,
Ludwig, this is the divine Zero.

852
00:59:32,859 --> 00:59:34,702
Gunther was slain
in the catacombs.

853
00:59:34,945 --> 00:59:37,698
Well, boys, who knows when we'll
all meet again, but if one day...

854
00:59:37,948 --> 00:59:38,995
Hold it.

855
00:59:41,994 --> 00:59:44,372
No time to gab.

856
00:59:44,621 --> 00:59:46,999
Take care of yourself,
Mr. Gustave.

857
00:59:47,165 --> 00:59:49,167
Good luck, kid.

858
00:59:52,796 --> 00:59:54,298
Which way to the safe house?

859
00:59:54,423 --> 00:59:55,891
I couldn't find one.

860
00:59:56,008 --> 00:59:59,057
No safe house? Really? We're
completely on our own out here?

861
00:59:59,219 --> 01:00:02,393
I'm afraid so. I asked around, but...

862
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:05,559
I understand. Too risky.
We'll just have to wing it, I suppose.

863
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:08,020
Let's put on our disguises.

864
01:00:08,186 --> 01:00:09,233
We're wearing them.

865
01:00:09,354 --> 01:00:10,355
No, we're not.

866
01:00:10,564 --> 01:00:13,033
We said false whiskers
and fake noses and so on.

867
01:00:13,191 --> 01:00:14,363
You didn't bring any?

868
01:00:14,526 --> 01:00:15,766
I thought you were growing one.

869
01:00:15,902 --> 01:00:18,826
And it wouldn't look
realistic, would it?

870
01:00:19,031 --> 01:00:21,204
No, when done properly,
they're perfectly convincing.

871
01:00:21,408 --> 01:00:23,376
But I take your point.
So be it.

872
01:00:23,535 --> 01:00:26,004
Give me a few squirts of <i>L'air
de Panache,</i> please, will you?

873
01:00:27,706 --> 01:00:29,333
Can I not get a squirt, even?

874
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:31,051
I forgot the <i>L'air de Panache.</i>

875
01:00:31,251 --> 01:00:33,845
Honestly, you forgot
the <i>L'air de Panache?</i>

876
01:00:34,046 --> 01:00:37,016
I don't believe it.
How could you?

877
01:00:37,215 --> 01:00:40,185
I've been in jail, Zero! Do you
understand how humiliating this is?

878
01:00:40,385 --> 01:00:42,387
I smell.

879
01:00:43,889 --> 01:00:46,267
That's just marvelous, isn't it?

880
01:00:46,516 --> 01:00:48,735
I suppose this is to
be expected back in...

881
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,232
Where do you come from again?

882
01:00:50,437 --> 01:00:51,939
Aq Salim al-Jabat.
Precisely.

883
01:00:52,189 --> 01:00:54,738
I suppose this is to be expected
back in Aq Salim al-Jabat

884
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,197
where one's prized possessions

885
01:00:56,401 --> 01:00:58,361
are a stack of filthy carpets
and a starving goat,

886
01:00:58,445 --> 01:01:02,245
and one sleeps behind a tent flap and
survives on wild dates and scarabs.

887
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:04,952
But it's not how I trained you.

888
01:01:05,202 --> 01:01:06,842
What on God's earth
possessed you to <i>leave</i>

889
01:01:06,912 --> 01:01:08,255
the homeland where
you obviously belong

890
01:01:08,413 --> 01:01:09,790
and travel unspeakable distances

891
01:01:09,915 --> 01:01:13,465
to become a penniless immigrant in a
refined, highly-cultivated society

892
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:16,714
that, quite frankly, could've
gotten along very well without you?

893
01:01:17,631 --> 01:01:18,632
The war.

894
01:01:19,758 --> 01:01:21,101
Say again?

895
01:01:21,259 --> 01:01:23,307
Well, you see,
my father was murdered

896
01:01:23,553 --> 01:01:26,147
and the rest of my family
were executed by firing squad.

897
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:27,812
Our village was
burned to the ground

898
01:01:28,058 --> 01:01:31,278
and those who managed to
survive were forced to flee.

899
01:01:31,436 --> 01:01:33,279
I left because of the war.

900
01:01:34,231 --> 01:01:37,952
I see. So you're, actually, really
more of a refugee, in that sense?

901
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:40,112
Truly.

902
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:43,999
Well, I suppose I'd better take
back everything I just said.

903
01:01:45,242 --> 01:01:48,337
What a bloody idiot I am.
Pathetic fool.

904
01:01:48,578 --> 01:01:50,672
Goddamn, selfish bastard.

905
01:01:50,914 --> 01:01:53,963
This is disgraceful, and it's beneath
the standards of the Grand Budapest.

906
01:01:55,627 --> 01:01:57,675
I apologize on
behalf of the hotel.

907
01:01:57,921 --> 01:02:00,361
It's not your fault. You were
just upset I forgot the perfume.

908
01:02:00,465 --> 01:02:04,470
Don't make excuses for me.
I owe you my life.

909
01:02:04,678 --> 01:02:08,524
You are my dear friend and protégé
and I'm very proud of you.

910
01:02:08,765 --> 01:02:11,018
You must know that.

911
01:02:11,268 --> 01:02:13,270
I'm so sorry, Zero.

912
01:02:14,813 --> 01:02:16,815
We're brothers.

913
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:26,992
How's our darling Agatha?

914
01:02:29,453 --> 01:02:32,707
"'Twas first light when I saw
her face upon the heath,

915
01:02:32,956 --> 01:02:35,550
and hence did I return,
day-by-day, entranced,

916
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:38,671
tho' vinegar did brine my
heart, never..."

917
01:02:38,837 --> 01:02:41,558
Very good. I'm going to stop you
there because the alarm has sounded,

918
01:02:41,715 --> 01:02:45,185
but remember where we left off
because I insist you finish later.

919
01:03:03,195 --> 01:03:05,948
I want roadblocks
at every junction for 50km.

920
01:03:06,156 --> 01:03:08,875
I want rail blocks at every
train station for 100km.

921
01:03:09,117 --> 01:03:10,710
I want 50 men and 10 bloodhounds

922
01:03:10,786 --> 01:03:11,958
ready in five minutes.

923
01:03:12,162 --> 01:03:13,709
We're going
to strip-search

924
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,470
every pretzel<i>-Haus,
Waffel</i>-hut, <i>Biergarten</i>

925
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,634
and especially every grand hotel

926
01:03:17,709 --> 01:03:19,336
from Äugenzburg to Zilchbrück.

927
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:21,551
These men are dangerous,
professional criminals.

928
01:03:21,797 --> 01:03:23,845
At least three of
them are anyway.

929
01:03:24,049 --> 01:03:25,050
Who are you?

930
01:03:27,469 --> 01:03:28,470
What are you doing here?

931
01:03:28,553 --> 01:03:30,226
Civilian personnel aren't
permitted in the cellblock.

932
01:03:30,305 --> 01:03:31,807
This is a military
investigation.

933
01:03:31,932 --> 01:03:33,434
This is Mr. Jopling, sir.

934
01:03:33,517 --> 01:03:35,736
His employer's mother
was one of the victims...

935
01:03:35,894 --> 01:03:38,238
Shut up.

936
01:03:39,231 --> 01:03:41,575
You work for the family
Desgoffe und Taxis?

937
01:03:41,733 --> 01:03:45,704
Are you aware of the murder of Deputy
Vilmos Kovacs on 23rd October?

938
01:03:45,904 --> 01:03:48,248
I'm aware of his disappearance.

939
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:51,050
His body was found stuffed in a
sarcophagus behind a storage room

940
01:03:51,201 --> 01:03:52,748
at the Kunstmuseum
late last night.

941
01:03:52,994 --> 01:03:55,588
<i>He was short four fingers.</i>

942
01:03:55,747 --> 01:03:57,044
What do you know about that?

943
01:03:57,165 --> 01:03:58,417
Nothing.

944
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:02,087
Escort Mr. Jopling
off the premises.

945
01:04:12,597 --> 01:04:14,599
Mendi's.

946
01:04:19,396 --> 01:04:21,615
Operator, get me the Excelsior
Palace in Baden-Jürgen

947
01:04:21,773 --> 01:04:23,275
and reverse the charges, please.

948
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:25,368
We've no choice. There's
nowhere else to turn.

949
01:04:25,569 --> 01:04:26,866
I'll hold.
Thank you.

950
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:29,789
It's our only hope. Otherwise, I shouldn't
even mention its existence to you.

951
01:04:29,948 --> 01:04:32,828
It goes without saying, never breathe
a word about this to a living soul.

952
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:34,711
Do you swear? Of course.
What is it, in fact?

953
01:04:34,911 --> 01:04:36,037
I can't say.

954
01:04:38,707 --> 01:04:40,459
How does one come by
front-row aisle seats

955
01:04:40,709 --> 01:04:43,963
for a first night at the Opera
Toscana with one day's notice?

956
01:04:44,129 --> 01:04:45,631
How does one arrange
a private viewing

957
01:04:45,881 --> 01:04:48,634
of the tapestry collection
at the Royal Saxon Gallery?

958
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,976
How does one secure a corner table
at Chez Dominique on a Thursday?

959
01:04:53,138 --> 01:04:55,436
Ivan, darling,
it's Gustave. Hello.

960
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,642
Well, I was until
about five minutes ago.

961
01:04:57,893 --> 01:05:00,988
We've taken it upon ourselves to clear
out in a hurry if you see what I mean.

962
01:05:01,146 --> 01:05:03,649
Well, through a sewer,
as it happens. Exactly.

963
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:06,536
Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to cut you
off, but we're in a bit of a bind.

964
01:05:06,651 --> 01:05:08,324
This is an official request.

965
01:05:08,486 --> 01:05:11,660
I'm formally calling upon
the special services of...

966
01:05:16,912 --> 01:05:18,334
<i>I'll call you back, Gustave.</i>

967
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,503
Right. Stand by.

968
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:23,923
I beg your pardon.
Do you prefer to walk?

969
01:05:24,127 --> 01:05:26,004
We're right here.
It's very simple.

970
01:05:26,254 --> 01:05:28,256
Straight down the corniche,
then left.

971
01:05:28,465 --> 01:05:30,467
Jojo, see the gentleman out.

972
01:05:33,345 --> 01:05:35,643
Get me <i>Monsieur</i> Georges
at the Château Luxe, please.

973
01:05:37,432 --> 01:05:39,810
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

974
01:05:41,102 --> 01:05:42,103
Take over.

975
01:05:42,187 --> 01:05:43,609
<i>Happy birthday, dear...</i>

976
01:05:43,772 --> 01:05:45,024
<i>Hello, Ivan?</i>

977
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:49,035
Got it.

978
01:05:49,277 --> 01:05:52,030
Get me <i>Monsieur</i> Dino at the
Palazzo Principessa, please.

979
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:56,126
Higher, goddammit, higher!

980
01:05:58,036 --> 01:05:59,709
Take over.

981
01:05:59,871 --> 01:06:01,464
<i>Monsieur Georges.</i>
Higher.

982
01:06:01,665 --> 01:06:03,838
I see. Straightaway.

983
01:06:05,377 --> 01:06:07,880
Get me <i>Monsieur</i> Robin at
l'Hôtel Côte du Cap, please.

984
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:11,508
...and two and three.

985
01:06:12,801 --> 01:06:15,645
<i>Monsieur</i> Robin. There's a call
from <i>Monsieur</i> Dino for you.

986
01:06:15,845 --> 01:06:17,847
Take over.

987
01:06:19,224 --> 01:06:20,567
One, two, three.

988
01:06:20,684 --> 01:06:21,981
<i>Yes, Dino.</i>

989
01:06:22,185 --> 01:06:25,485
Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino.

990
01:06:27,232 --> 01:06:29,826
Get me <i>Monsieur</i> Martin
at the Ritz Imperial, please.

991
01:06:31,528 --> 01:06:33,405
Too much salt.

992
01:06:33,571 --> 01:06:35,118
Not enough pepper.

993
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,702
Take over.

994
01:06:40,745 --> 01:06:42,839
<i>Robin? Martin.</i>
Too much salt.

995
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:45,041
So I've heard.

996
01:06:46,376 --> 01:06:49,346
Maybe.
Let me make a few calls.

997
01:06:54,426 --> 01:06:56,929
Serge X, missing.
Deputy Kovacs, also missing.

998
01:06:57,095 --> 01:06:59,939
Madame D, dead. <i>Boy with
Apple,</i> stolen, by us.

999
01:07:00,098 --> 01:07:02,567
Dmitri and Jopling, ruthless,
cold-blooded savages.

1000
01:07:02,767 --> 01:07:06,021
Gustave H, at large.
What else?

1001
01:07:06,229 --> 01:07:07,526
Zero, confused.

1002
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,944
Zero, confused, indeed.

1003
01:07:09,107 --> 01:07:11,280
The plot "thickens,"
as they say.

1004
01:07:11,526 --> 01:07:14,120
Why, by the way?
Is it a soup metaphor?

1005
01:07:14,362 --> 01:07:16,364
I don't know.

1006
01:07:21,202 --> 01:07:22,795
Get in.

1007
01:07:25,248 --> 01:07:26,545
We found the butler.

1008
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,549
He's hiding out in the remote
foothills near Gabelmeister's Peak.

1009
01:07:29,753 --> 01:07:31,881
Our Contact convinced him
to meet you midday tomorrow

1010
01:07:32,088 --> 01:07:33,465
at the observatory
on the summit.

1011
01:07:33,631 --> 01:07:35,975
Tell no one.
He'll explain everything.

1012
01:07:36,217 --> 01:07:38,265
Your train departs
in four and a half minutes.

1013
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:39,892
Here's your tickets.

1014
01:07:40,096 --> 01:07:41,143
Third class?

1015
01:07:41,306 --> 01:07:42,307
It was overbooked

1016
01:07:42,557 --> 01:07:46,152
but the conductor used to be a
sommelier at the old Versailles.

1017
01:07:46,311 --> 01:07:47,483
He pulled some strings.

1018
01:07:47,771 --> 01:07:49,773
You'll need these
for the dining car.

1019
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:54,652
One last thing.

1020
01:07:56,321 --> 01:07:58,323
<i>L'air de Panache</i>

1021
01:08:00,825 --> 01:08:02,998
They only had
the half-ounce.

1022
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:09,292
We should give him something
as a symbolic gesture.

1023
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:11,754
How much money you got? 42
Klubecks and 3 postage stamps.

1024
01:08:11,961 --> 01:08:13,963
Give me 25. Yes.

1025
01:08:17,675 --> 01:08:19,052
Bless you.

1026
01:08:19,177 --> 01:08:20,599
Please.

1027
01:08:36,986 --> 01:08:38,078
I've got to hand it to him.

1028
01:08:38,154 --> 01:08:39,314
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

1029
01:08:39,322 --> 01:08:43,077
I didn't see that coming.
Well, what do you want next?

1030
01:08:43,201 --> 01:08:48,549
<i>Talk to the club-footed sister
again, and, this time, be persuasive.</i>

1031
01:08:55,672 --> 01:08:58,471
Goddamn son of a bitch.

1032
01:09:22,031 --> 01:09:24,033
Holy fuck!

1033
01:09:28,371 --> 01:09:31,250
What's the meaning of this shit?

1034
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:33,056
<i>Boy with Apple?</i>
I thought you'd hidden it.

1035
01:09:33,126 --> 01:09:35,595
Why are you only noticing now? I
assumed it went to the tax appraiser.

1036
01:09:35,837 --> 01:09:37,510
Are you fucking kidding me?

1037
01:09:37,589 --> 01:09:39,591
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

1038
01:09:40,091 --> 01:09:42,890
I believe it was removed
by <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

1039
01:09:50,768 --> 01:09:51,894
I'm not angry with Serge.

1040
01:09:52,103 --> 01:09:54,572
You can't blame someone for their
basic lack of moral fiber.

1041
01:09:54,772 --> 01:09:56,740
He's a frightened, little,
yellow-bellied coward.

1042
01:09:56,941 --> 01:09:58,981
It's not his fault, is it? I don't know.
It depends.

1043
01:09:59,194 --> 01:10:00,741
Well, you can say that
about most anything.

1044
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:02,242
"It depends."
Of course it depends.

1045
01:10:02,447 --> 01:10:04,127
Of course it depends.
Of course it depends.

1046
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:06,293
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Of course it depends.

1047
01:10:06,534 --> 01:10:09,959
That doesn't mean I'm not going
to throttle the little swamp rat.

1048
01:10:12,457 --> 01:10:16,758
May I officiate, by the way?
The ceremony?

1049
01:10:16,961 --> 01:10:17,962
With pleasure.

1050
01:10:18,129 --> 01:10:20,757
I must say, I find that
girl utterly delightful.

1051
01:10:20,965 --> 01:10:22,467
Flat as a board,
enormous birthmark

1052
01:10:22,717 --> 01:10:24,469
the shape of Mexico
over half her face,

1053
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,813
sweating for hours on end
in that sweltering kitchen

1054
01:10:26,971 --> 01:10:28,393
while Mendl,
genius though he is,

1055
01:10:28,598 --> 01:10:30,145
looms over her like
a hulking gorilla.

1056
01:10:30,391 --> 01:10:32,564
Yet without question,
without fail,

1057
01:10:32,769 --> 01:10:35,989
always and invariably,
she's exceedingly lovely.

1058
01:10:36,147 --> 01:10:37,490
Why?

1059
01:10:37,732 --> 01:10:40,326
Because of her purity.

1060
01:10:42,403 --> 01:10:44,656
She admires you as well,
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

1061
01:10:44,822 --> 01:10:46,165
Does she?

1062
01:10:46,282 --> 01:10:47,579
Very much.

1063
01:10:47,784 --> 01:10:51,584
That's a good sign, you know.
It means she "gets it."

1064
01:10:51,788 --> 01:10:53,790
That's important.

1065
01:10:56,251 --> 01:10:58,253
Don't flirt with her.

1066
01:11:44,132 --> 01:11:47,557
A radio telegram was delivered
and signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM.

1067
01:11:47,719 --> 01:11:50,400
The envelope was found near the body,
but its contents were missing.

1068
01:11:51,139 --> 01:11:52,482
However, the telegraph
office always keeps

1069
01:11:52,557 --> 01:11:54,309
a carbon of the ticker tape
for 24 hours.

1070
01:11:54,517 --> 01:11:56,736
I copied it down.
It reads as follows,

1071
01:11:57,729 --> 01:11:58,901
"Pack your things stop."

1072
01:11:59,147 --> 01:12:01,241
"Be ready to leave
at moment's notice stop."

1073
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:03,868
"Hide-out is vicinity
of Gabelmeister's Peak stop."

1074
01:12:04,068 --> 01:12:06,491
"Destroy this message
all my love full stop."

1075
01:12:07,572 --> 01:12:09,370
Where's the basket?

1076
01:12:34,682 --> 01:12:36,684
Where you headed, mister?

1077
01:12:40,396 --> 01:12:42,740
Skiing? Sledding?
Mountain climbing?

1078
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:54,418
Three Klubecks.

1079
01:13:04,545 --> 01:13:06,465
<i>By express
wireless, I wrote Agatha</i>

1080
01:13:06,547 --> 01:13:09,300
<i>with instructions to move
to our pre-arranged hideout,</i>

1081
01:13:09,467 --> 01:13:11,970
<i>a Gypsy caravan
on the outer Nebelsbad road,</i>

1082
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,972
<i>while Monsieur Gustave
and I continued east</i>

1083
01:13:14,222 --> 01:13:15,599
<i>into the Zubrowkian Alps,</i>

1084
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:19,562
<i>toward our high-altitude rendezvous
with the butler Serge X.</i>

1085
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:23,777
<i>As a precaution,
we disembarked quietly</i>

1086
01:13:23,981 --> 01:13:26,404
<i>in the freight yard
just outside the station.</i>

1087
01:13:33,991 --> 01:13:35,834
<i>L'air de Panache.</i>

1088
01:13:46,462 --> 01:13:48,942
It's a hell of a view. I give
them that, for what's it's worth.

1089
01:13:48,965 --> 01:13:50,967
I agree.

1090
01:14:02,019 --> 01:14:05,489
"'Tis oft'-remarked, no single,
falling-flake does any other

1091
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:09,326
in its pure and perfect form..."
Somebody's coming.

1092
01:14:11,863 --> 01:14:15,037
Are you <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

1093
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:16,496
Uh-huh.

1094
01:14:16,617 --> 01:14:17,869
Get on the next cable car.

1095
01:14:57,408 --> 01:15:00,833
Are you <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

1096
01:15:01,037 --> 01:15:02,038
Uh-huh.

1097
01:15:02,163 --> 01:15:03,164
Switch with me.

1098
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:35,454
Are you <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

1099
01:15:35,696 --> 01:15:37,039
Uh-huh.

1100
01:15:37,156 --> 01:15:38,453
Put these on and sing.

1101
01:16:03,975 --> 01:16:05,443
Psst.

1102
01:16:06,602 --> 01:16:07,774
Are you <i>Monsieur</i>
Gustave of the...

1103
01:16:07,895 --> 01:16:09,067
Yes, dammit.

1104
01:16:09,272 --> 01:16:10,273
Confess.

1105
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:12,279
I'm innocent.

1106
01:16:12,483 --> 01:16:14,326
Hmm? No, no.

1107
01:16:23,828 --> 01:16:26,502
Forgive me, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.
I never meant to betray you.

1108
01:16:26,664 --> 01:16:28,086
They threatened my life and now

1109
01:16:28,207 --> 01:16:29,629
they've murdered my only family.

1110
01:16:29,834 --> 01:16:31,427
No. Who did they
kill this time?

1111
01:16:31,627 --> 01:16:32,753
My dear sister.

1112
01:16:32,878 --> 01:16:34,004
The girl with the club foot?

1113
01:16:34,171 --> 01:16:35,593
Yes.
Those fuckers!

1114
01:16:35,798 --> 01:16:37,238
I tried to warn you
at the beginning.

1115
01:16:37,425 --> 01:16:38,847
I know, darling.
Let's put that behind us.

1116
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:40,512
Listen, I hate to
put you on the spot,

1117
01:16:40,636 --> 01:16:42,104
but I really must ask
you to clear my name.

1118
01:16:42,305 --> 01:16:45,354
Obviously you're grieving...
There's more.

1119
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,943
To the story.
I get it. Go on.

1120
01:16:47,143 --> 01:16:49,145
I was the official witness
in Madame D's presence

1121
01:16:49,353 --> 01:16:50,946
to the creation of a second will

1122
01:16:51,147 --> 01:16:54,196
to be executed only in the
event of her death by murder.

1123
01:16:54,358 --> 01:16:55,860
A second will?
Right.

1124
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:57,657
In case she got bumped off?
Right.

1125
01:16:57,862 --> 01:16:59,284
Uh-huh?
But they destroyed it.

1126
01:16:59,488 --> 01:17:00,956
Oh, dear.
However...

1127
01:17:01,157 --> 01:17:02,659
Uh-huh?
I pulled a copy.

1128
01:17:02,867 --> 01:17:04,995
A second copy of
the second will?

1129
01:17:05,202 --> 01:17:06,499
Right.
Uh-huh?

1130
01:17:09,206 --> 01:17:11,550
What does it say? Where is it?
What's it all about, dammit?

1131
01:17:11,709 --> 01:17:12,749
Don't keep us in suspense.

1132
01:17:12,793 --> 01:17:14,511
This has been a complete
fucking nightmare.

1133
01:17:14,712 --> 01:17:17,135
Just tell us what
the fuck is going on!

1134
01:17:18,966 --> 01:17:20,388
Serge?

1135
01:17:20,509 --> 01:17:22,182
Serge? Serge!

1136
01:17:26,223 --> 01:17:28,567
Bloody hell. They've
strangled the poor slob.

1137
01:17:56,545 --> 01:17:57,546
Come on! Let's go!

1138
01:18:05,513 --> 01:18:06,673
What do we do if we catch him?

1139
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:07,728
I don't know.

1140
01:18:07,932 --> 01:18:10,230
He's a homicidal psychopath.
Let's stop.

1141
01:18:10,434 --> 01:18:12,687
I can't. I can barely steer.

1142
01:19:20,504 --> 01:19:24,134
You sick, pathetic creep.
I hate you.

1143
01:19:36,854 --> 01:19:39,277
"'If this do be me end, farewell"

1144
01:19:39,356 --> 01:19:40,699
cried the wounded piper-boy,

1145
01:19:42,276 --> 01:19:43,402
whilst the muskets cracked

1146
01:19:43,486 --> 01:19:44,863
and the yeomen
roared 'Hurrah!'"

1147
01:19:45,029 --> 01:19:46,201
"And the ramparts fell."

1148
01:19:47,865 --> 01:19:51,460
"'Methinks me breathes me
last, me fears!' said he..."

1149
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,537
Holy shit! You got him!

1150
01:19:53,788 --> 01:19:55,711
Well done, Zero!

1151
01:20:06,884 --> 01:20:09,228
<i>Gustave H! You are
a fugitive from justice!</i>

1152
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:12,064
<i>Surrender lawfully and
I will personally vouchsafe</i>

1153
01:20:12,348 --> 01:20:13,349
<i>your fair treatment.</i>

1154
01:20:13,474 --> 01:20:15,021
<i>Do not attempt to flee!</i>

1155
01:20:15,226 --> 01:20:16,728
What do you think?
I don't know.

1156
01:20:16,894 --> 01:20:18,316
I'd rather jump off
this cliff right now

1157
01:20:18,437 --> 01:20:19,814
than go back to fucking prison.

1158
01:20:20,022 --> 01:20:22,462
I say we steal that sick maniac's
motorcycle, go fetch Agatha,

1159
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,697
take back <i>Boy with Apple</i>

1160
01:20:23,776 --> 01:20:25,403
and head for the Maltese
Riviera, once and for all.

1161
01:20:25,653 --> 01:20:28,406
Very good! You're so extraordinary, Zero.
Thank you.

1162
01:20:28,572 --> 01:20:31,075
A moment of silence in
memoriam of a devoted servant

1163
01:20:31,325 --> 01:20:34,044
killed violently during
the conduct of his duties.

1164
01:20:36,997 --> 01:20:38,999
Goodbye, Serge.

1165
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:42,503
Okay, let's go.

1166
01:20:55,307 --> 01:20:57,105
<i>The war began at midnight.</i>

1167
01:20:57,268 --> 01:20:59,771
<i>Pffeifelstad fell by lunch
under heavy shelling,</i>

1168
01:20:59,979 --> 01:21:03,324
<i>and 10 battalions surged across
the long western border.</i>

1169
01:21:03,524 --> 01:21:05,322
<i>High-command
advanced to Nebelsbad.</i>

1170
01:21:17,538 --> 01:21:21,168
Compliments of <i>Herr</i> Mendl,
for the executive staff.

1171
01:21:24,295 --> 01:21:27,655
General Stieglitz requests a garden-view
sitting room with an extra roll-away.

1172
01:21:27,673 --> 01:21:29,641
Let's put him in
the Duke Leopold Suite.

1173
01:21:29,842 --> 01:21:31,515
Secretary Woroniecki's
office cabled.

1174
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:35,314
He's checking in a day early.
Rooms 401 -2-3.

1175
01:21:35,472 --> 01:21:37,145
Tell Tactical Logistics
we're moving them

1176
01:21:37,308 --> 01:21:38,869
to a standard double
on the third floor.

1177
01:21:39,059 --> 01:21:40,902
They'll need more
space than that.

1178
01:22:04,001 --> 01:22:08,677
The beginning of the end of
the end of the beginning has begun.

1179
01:22:08,839 --> 01:22:11,888
A sad finale played off-key
on a broken-down saloon piano

1180
01:22:12,092 --> 01:22:14,686
in the outskirts of
a forgotten ghost town.

1181
01:22:14,845 --> 01:22:16,847
I'd rather not bear witness
to such blasphemy.

1182
01:22:17,056 --> 01:22:18,057
Me neither.

1183
01:22:18,265 --> 01:22:20,563
The Grand Budapest
has become a troops' barracks.

1184
01:22:20,768 --> 01:22:23,237
I shall never cross its
threshold again in my lifetime.

1185
01:22:23,437 --> 01:22:24,939
Me neither.
Never again shall I...

1186
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:28,193
Actually, I think we might be going
in there right now after all.

1187
01:22:29,944 --> 01:22:31,446
Dmitri.

1188
01:22:34,406 --> 01:22:36,124
Agatha.

1189
01:22:46,794 --> 01:22:49,035
Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.
I'm <i>Monsieur</i> Chuck.

1190
01:22:49,129 --> 01:22:52,383
We've booked you and your sisters
into the King Ferdinand Suite.

1191
01:22:52,591 --> 01:22:54,559
Good evening. General Von
Shrecker asked me...

1192
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,057
Who's that?

1193
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:57,563
I beg your pardon?

1194
01:22:57,721 --> 01:23:00,474
I think that girl's
got my picture. Excuse me.

1195
01:23:17,074 --> 01:23:19,076
- Six.
- Hold it.

1196
01:23:22,246 --> 01:23:23,293
Six.

1197
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:28,256
Compliments of <i>Herr</i> Mendl.

1198
01:23:44,435 --> 01:23:45,436
Excuse me.

1199
01:23:45,602 --> 01:23:47,803
Have you seen a pastry girl
with a package under her arm

1200
01:23:47,938 --> 01:23:49,138
in the last minute and a half?

1201
01:23:49,273 --> 01:23:51,713
Yep. She just got on the elevator with Mr.
Desgoffe und Taxis.

1202
01:23:51,775 --> 01:23:53,994
Thank you.

1203
01:23:54,194 --> 01:23:55,616
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

1204
01:23:55,779 --> 01:23:57,406
Otto, sir, the new Lobby Boy.

1205
01:23:57,531 --> 01:23:59,124
You haven't been
trained properly.

1206
01:23:59,324 --> 01:24:01,452
A Lobby Boy never provides
information of that kind.

1207
01:24:01,618 --> 01:24:03,620
You're a stone wall.
Understood?

1208
01:24:20,471 --> 01:24:22,064
Pretty picture.

1209
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:23,891
Sixth floor.

1210
01:25:07,684 --> 01:25:09,402
Where's <i>Boy with Apple?</i>

1211
01:25:10,354 --> 01:25:12,607
None of your goddamn business!

1212
01:25:13,398 --> 01:25:17,073
I'm going to blast your candy-ass
once and for all right now.

1213
01:25:26,537 --> 01:25:28,084
Drop your weapon!

1214
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:52,233
Cease fire! Cease fire! Whoa!

1215
01:25:52,437 --> 01:25:53,780
Stop it!

1216
01:25:53,981 --> 01:25:55,574
Who's shooting who?

1217
01:25:55,732 --> 01:25:58,235
That's Gustave H! The escaped
murderer and art thief.

1218
01:25:58,443 --> 01:25:59,615
I've got him cornered!

1219
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:01,242
That's Dmitri
Desgoffe und Taxis!

1220
01:26:01,446 --> 01:26:03,448
He's responsible for the
killing of Deputy Kovacs,

1221
01:26:03,657 --> 01:26:06,501
Serge X and his club-footed
sister, plus his own mother!

1222
01:26:08,078 --> 01:26:10,251
Nobody move.
Everybody's under arrest.

1223
01:26:11,623 --> 01:26:13,921
Who's out the window?

1224
01:26:14,084 --> 01:26:16,086
Agatha!

1225
01:26:22,259 --> 01:26:23,306
310-bis.

1226
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:24,727
Hang on! Here I come!

1227
01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:51,213
Something's
on the back of the...

1228
01:26:57,628 --> 01:26:58,629
Agatha!

1229
01:26:58,795 --> 01:27:00,513
Agatha!

1230
01:27:00,714 --> 01:27:02,716
Are you all right?
I think so.

1231
01:27:04,384 --> 01:27:06,352
Something's on
the back of the picture.

1232
01:27:19,733 --> 01:27:20,734
<i>She left everything</i>

1233
01:27:20,817 --> 01:27:22,535
<i>to Monsieur Gustave, of course.</i>

1234
01:27:24,488 --> 01:27:26,832
<i>The mansion,
known as Schloss Lutz,</i>

1235
01:27:28,325 --> 01:27:31,420
<i>the factories, which produced
weapons, medicine and textiles,</i>

1236
01:27:34,373 --> 01:27:36,046
<i>an important
newspaper syndicate,</i>

1237
01:27:37,167 --> 01:27:39,545
<i>and perhaps
you've already deduced</i>

1238
01:27:39,878 --> 01:27:45,556
<i>this very institution,
the Grand Budapest Hotel.</i>

1239
01:27:45,884 --> 01:27:47,386
<i>He anointed me his successor,</i>

1240
01:27:47,594 --> 01:27:50,518
<i>and as the war continued,
I served my adopted country</i>

1241
01:27:50,681 --> 01:27:53,901
<i>from the narrow desk still found
against the wall in the next room.</i>

1242
01:27:55,352 --> 01:27:57,446
<i>He was the same
as his disciples,</i>

1243
01:27:57,688 --> 01:28:01,033
<i>insecure, vain,
superficial, blond, needy.</i>

1244
01:28:01,858 --> 01:28:04,077
<i>In the end he was even rich.</i>

1245
01:28:05,445 --> 01:28:08,619
<i>He did not succeed, however,
in growing old.</i>

1246
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:15,247
"Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together..."

1247
01:28:15,455 --> 01:28:17,298
<i>Nor did my darling Agatha.</i>

1248
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:19,794
<i>She and our infant son would
be killed two years later</i>

1249
01:28:20,043 --> 01:28:22,887
<i>by the Prussian grippe.
An absurd little disease.</i>

1250
01:28:23,088 --> 01:28:25,637
<i>Today we treat it
in a single week,</i>

1251
01:28:25,757 --> 01:28:28,306
<i>but, in those days
many millions died.</i>

1252
01:28:31,596 --> 01:28:33,439
<i>On the 21st day
of the occupation,</i>

1253
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:36,393
<i>the morning the independent
state of Zubrowka</i>

1254
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,732
<i>officially ceased to exist,</i>

1255
01:28:37,894 --> 01:28:39,896
<i>we traveled with
Monsieur Gustave to Lutz.</i>

1256
01:28:40,063 --> 01:28:42,316
In answer to your earlier
question, by the way,

1257
01:28:42,566 --> 01:28:44,409
of course.

1258
01:28:46,236 --> 01:28:49,080
Zero asked me about my humble
beginnings in the hotel trade.

1259
01:28:49,239 --> 01:28:51,583
I was, perhaps, for a time,
considered the best Lobby Boy

1260
01:28:51,783 --> 01:28:54,161
we'd ever had at
the Grand Budapest.

1261
01:28:54,411 --> 01:28:55,833
I think I can say that.

1262
01:28:56,079 --> 01:28:57,922
This one finally surpassed me.

1263
01:28:58,123 --> 01:29:01,093
Although, I must say,
he had an exceptional teacher.

1264
01:29:01,251 --> 01:29:02,423
Truly.

1265
01:29:07,674 --> 01:29:10,644
"Whence came these two
radiant, celestial brothers,

1266
01:29:10,844 --> 01:29:12,141
united, for an instant,

1267
01:29:12,346 --> 01:29:16,601
as they crossed the stratosphere
of our starry window?"

1268
01:29:16,808 --> 01:29:19,607
"One from the East
and one from the West."

1269
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:21,522
Very good.

1270
01:29:21,772 --> 01:29:23,774
Don't flirt with her.

1271
01:29:26,109 --> 01:29:28,362
Why are we stopping
at a barley field again?

1272
01:29:36,703 --> 01:29:39,832
I find these black
uniforms very drab.

1273
01:29:44,336 --> 01:29:45,633
Well, hello there, chaps.

1274
01:29:45,712 --> 01:29:47,305
We were just talking about you.

1275
01:29:47,547 --> 01:29:49,345
Documents, please.

1276
01:29:49,466 --> 01:29:51,309
With pleasure, as always.

1277
01:29:55,722 --> 01:29:57,520
You're the first of
the official death squads

1278
01:29:57,724 --> 01:29:59,977
to whom we've been
formally introduced.

1279
01:30:00,143 --> 01:30:02,145
How do you do?

1280
01:30:03,355 --> 01:30:05,403
<i>Plus ça change,</i> am I right?

1281
01:30:09,861 --> 01:30:13,240
Uh, that's a migratory visa with
stage three worker status, darling.

1282
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:14,491
Read this.

1283
01:30:23,834 --> 01:30:25,177
Come outside.

1284
01:30:25,335 --> 01:30:26,678
Now, stay there.

1285
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,178
I give you my word, if you
lay a finger on this man,

1286
01:30:31,383 --> 01:30:33,556
I'll see you
dishonorably discharged,

1287
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,855
locked up in the stockade
and hanged by sundown.

1288
01:30:38,181 --> 01:30:40,024
<i>There are still
faint glimmers of civilization</i>

1289
01:30:40,183 --> 01:30:42,356
<i>left in this
barbaric slaughterhouse</i>

1290
01:30:42,477 --> 01:30:44,571
<i>that was once known as humanity.</i>

1291
01:30:47,899 --> 01:30:51,244
You filthy, goddamn,
pock-marked, fascist assholes!

1292
01:30:52,362 --> 01:30:55,036
<i>He was one of them.</i>

1293
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,163
<i>What more is there to say?</i>

1294
01:31:04,916 --> 01:31:07,544
What happened in the end?

1295
01:31:07,752 --> 01:31:09,754
In the end they shot him.

1296
01:31:11,548 --> 01:31:13,550
So it all went to me.

1297
01:31:22,392 --> 01:31:25,646
<i>After dinner, we went
to collect the keys to our rooms,</i>

1298
01:31:25,896 --> 01:31:27,739
<i>but Monsieur Jean
had abandoned his post.</i>

1299
01:31:27,898 --> 01:31:30,071
I expect he's forgotten
all about us.

1300
01:31:30,275 --> 01:31:31,401
<i>In recent years, of course,</i>

1301
01:31:31,568 --> 01:31:33,821
<i>such properties and holdings
as the Grand Budapest</i>

1302
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:37,665
<i>had with very few exceptions
become common property.</i>

1303
01:31:38,617 --> 01:31:40,665
<i>While the precise terms
of his negotiation</i>

1304
01:31:40,911 --> 01:31:42,831
<i>with the new government
had never been announced,</i>

1305
01:31:42,996 --> 01:31:44,196
<i>the result was an open secret,</i>

1306
01:31:45,081 --> 01:31:47,800
<i>Zero Moustafa had traded
a great and important fortune</i>

1307
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:52,302
<i>in exchange for one costly,
unprofitable, doomed hotel.</i>

1308
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:54,341
<i>Why?</i>

1309
01:31:54,591 --> 01:31:56,639
<i>Was it merely sentimental?</i>

1310
01:31:56,843 --> 01:32:00,598
<i>It was quite forward of me
and a bit out of character,</i>

1311
01:32:00,764 --> 01:32:02,607
<i>but I felt I must know,</i>

1312
01:32:02,849 --> 01:32:04,851
<i>for my health, I suppose.</i>

1313
01:32:07,437 --> 01:32:09,656
Forgive me for asking.
I hope I haven't upset you.

1314
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,858
No, of course not.

1315
01:32:12,943 --> 01:32:15,787
Is it simply your last connection
to that vanished world,

1316
01:32:15,946 --> 01:32:18,290
his world, if you will?

1317
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:20,208
His world?

1318
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:23,454
No, I don't think so.

1319
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:25,714
You see, we shared a vocation.

1320
01:32:25,956 --> 01:32:27,674
It wouldn't have been necessary.

1321
01:32:27,874 --> 01:32:32,550
No. The hotel
I keep for Agatha.

1322
01:32:34,005 --> 01:32:35,302
We were happy here.

1323
01:32:35,507 --> 01:32:37,509
For a little while.

1324
01:32:42,847 --> 01:32:45,145
To be frank, I think
his world had vanished

1325
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:47,227
long before he ever entered it.

1326
01:32:47,477 --> 01:32:49,024
But, I will say,

1327
01:32:49,229 --> 01:32:52,733
he certainly sustained the
illusion with a marvelous grace.

1328
01:32:54,317 --> 01:32:56,536
Are you going up?
No, I'll sit for a little while.

1329
01:32:56,736 --> 01:32:58,534
Good night.

1330
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:05,031
<i>The next week,</i>

1331
01:33:05,203 --> 01:33:07,422
<i>I sailed for a cure
in South America</i>

1332
01:33:07,664 --> 01:33:10,258
<i>and began a long,
wandering journey abroad.</i>

1333
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:13,344
<i>I did not return to
Europe for many years.</i>

1334
01:33:18,383 --> 01:33:20,852
<i>It was an enchanting old ruin.</i>

1335
01:33:26,057 --> 01:33:28,355
<i>But I never
managed to see it again.</i>
